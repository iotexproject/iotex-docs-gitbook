# Quick Start

Congratulations on receiving your Pebble!

This quick start guide will help you quickly explore a small number of features of your Pebble.

## Hardware Setup

Before start using your Pebble, you need three simple steps to hook up the device with a few components (see the [Hardware Setup](hardware-setup.md) guide for more details):

* Insert the IoT SIM card into the SIM card slot
* Connect the NB-IoT/LTE-M antenna
* Connect the rechargeable Lithium Polymer Ion battery pack
* Press the [Power Button](hardware-setup.md#inserting-a-sim-card) for 2 seconds to Power on

Check out the [on-board RGB led](technical-specification.md#onboard-rgb-led) to monitor the status of your Pebble.

## Dashboard Setup

The default firmware installed on Pebble will connect the device to [trypebble.io](https://trypebble.io), the **IoTeX free Pebble Backend Service** built using open-source software including [hmq](https://github.com/fhmq/hmq), [MinIO ](https://min.io)and [Thingsboard](https://thingsboard.io).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The IoTeX hosted backend solely aims for the initial validation of Pebble functionalities: **all the dashboards and data are accessible by all Pebble users**. As a result, we do encourage users to deploy their own backend service: check out [Deploy your own backend service](setup-modes/development-mode/) for instructions on how to deploy your own backend, and [Configure AWS IoT Core](setup-modes/production-mode/) for instructions on how to deploy a backend for production.
{% endhint %}

### Login to the Dashboard

To setup your dashboard, you can login into Thingsboard at http://trypebble.io:8080/login using the following credentials:

`Username: tenant@thingsboard.org`\
`Passworld: tenant`\


**Please Note that the login credentials are shared by all Pebble users, so please do not change them!**

### Create Your Dashboard

Before creating a dashboard for your Pebble, you need to ensure that the data from your device has been successfully filtered out by Thingsboard. To this end, you can click the **DEVICES** icon on the Thingsboard console:

In the **Devices** window, you can check whether your device IMEI number occurs in the list of device names, (your device name will look like `nrf-XXXXXXXXXXXX` where `XX..X` stands for the unique 15-digit IMEI number of your Pebble, which can be found printed on a label inside the Pebble box).

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig2.png)

Once you located your Pebble's IMEI in the list, you can move on and click **DASHBOARDS** on the left menu. If you can't find your device in the list, [check out the status Led](technical-specification.md#onboard-rgb-led) on your board to make sure it's connected to the cellular network, otherwise you may need to [reconfigure and flash a new firmware](flashing-the-firmware/) for your Pebble to support a different standard for the cellular network available in your country.

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig3.png)

In the **Dashboards** window, you can click `+`on the top right corner and select **import dashboard**

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig4.png)

Download the [IoTeX's dashboard template ](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iotexproject/pebble-backend/master/example/dashboard/pebble_template.json)(right-click and save the file) and drop the file into the pop-up window.

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig5.png)

After clicking **IMPORT**, you will notice that a new dashboard named `pebble-1` showed up at the top of the list in the **Dashboards** window. You can then click the **Open dashboard** button to open your dashboard.

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig6.png)

Once your dashboard is launched, you need to enter **edit mode** by clicking the orange edit button on the bottom right corner of your dashboard.

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig7.png)

The first thing is to change is the title of the dashboard: rename it from `pebble-1` to your device name `nrf-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, to differentiate your dashboard from those of other users.

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig8.png)

Then you need to click **Entity aliases** button to set up the data source for your dashboard: in the **Entity aliases** window, you should first change the **Alias name** from `pebble-1` to your device name `**nrf-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx**` and then click the **Edit alias** button on the right:

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig9.png)

In the **Edit alias** window, you need to click the line labeled **Device**, and choose your device from the drop-down list.

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig10.png)

Saving your changes in the dialog boxes, then click the orange **Apply changes** button at the bottom right of the screen: the data stream from your Pebble will show in the dashboard.

## Configure Your Pebble

As shown in your dashboard, the default firmware on Pebble sends all the following sensor/GPS data to the backend periodically:

* Temperature
* Air Pressure
* Humidity
* Gas
* 3-Axis Accelerometer
* 3-Axis Gyroscope
* Light Intensity
* Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
* Battery

If you would like to stop updating some sensor/GPS data on the dashboard, you can use the **CONFIG ME** button as follows:

1. Click the orange **Edit** button on the bottom right corner of your dashboard;
2. Click the 'Edit widget' button on the 'Config data collection' panel;

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig12.png)

1. Click **ADVANCED** in the pop-up window **CONFIG DATA COLLECTION**, select **Shared attribute** for the **Device attribute scope**, and copy the following JSON configuration into the **Device attribute parameters** field:

```javascript
{
  "data_channel": "7895"
}
```

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig13.png)

For selecting/deselecting certain sensors/GPS data, you can set '1'/'0' in the corresponding position as shown in the figure below and convert the resulting binary string to the corresponding decimal value that is then assigned to the **data_channel** field in the above JSON configuration.

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig14.png)

In the above example, we set **data_channel** to be `7895` (corresponding to `1111011010111` in binary representation). As a result, the temperature will not be updated on the dashboard after Pebble receives this configuration.

1. After applying the changes and returning to the main dashboard, you can click the **CONFIG ME** button to send the new configuration to your Pebble;
2. The new configuration will take effect shortly and the selected sensor/GPS data will not be updated any longer.

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig15.png)

## Beep Your Pebble

For testing the buzzer on your Pebble, you can use the **BEEP ME** button and follow the same steps used in the above section **configuring your Pebble**. The only difference is the JSON configuration in the **Device attribute parameters** field, that now becomes:

```javascript
{
  "beep": "2000"
}
```

![](http://docs-old.iotex.io/img/developer/pebble-quickstart/pebble_quick_start_guide_fig16.png)

After saving and clicking the **BEEP ME** button on the card the buzzer of your Pebble will beep for 2000ms (as soon as the configuration is received).
