# Overview

The IoTeX platform combines blockchain, decentralized identity, and **secure hardware** to enable trusted IoT devices and services that are owned by users, not corporations.

In early 2020, IoTeX joined forces with [Nordic Semiconductor ](https://www.nordicsemi.com/)to explore the intersection of tamper-proof hardware and software. Our goal was to meet the most stringent security and privacy requirements demanded by modern asset tracking applications. Pebble utilizes Nordic's **nRF9160 SiP** featuring Arm TrustZone™ for trusted execution and Arm CryptoCell 310 for application-layer security. In addition, the nRF9160 is the first secure hardware to sync with the IoTeX blockchain for decentralized applications.

IoTeX's Pebble meets the demand of applications that require strong data security, integrity protection, and multiparty trust across the entire supply chain. **Existing asset tracking solutions lack critical security features**, rendering them easily hackable and exposed to data corruption.

For the IoT to reach its full potential, the ability for anyone to verify the underlying data and code are trustworthy is paramount. As our world becomes more digitized by the day, Pebble establishes a new standard for trust based on transparency, reliability, and verifiability.

### Who is Pebble for? <a id="who-is-pebble-for"></a>

Pebble is ideal for **IoT developers** of all skill levels that are interested in building **highly secure** and **verifiable** solutions. Pebble can capture, **sign**, and transmit data in real-time to any MQTT endpoint, and a hosted backend is available with integration to ThingsBoard for plug-and-play data visualization allowing anyone to get started building on tamper-proof hardware with ease!

For **Supply Chain developers**, Pebble establishes a higher standard of **trust** for supply chain and transportation & logistics use cases with verifiable GPS, climate, motion, and light data. Pebble can serve as an **unbiased third party** in consortium scenarios where absolute trust is needed.

**Blockchain Developers** can use the Pebble Blockchain SDK to index sensors data and utilize it in blockchain smart contracts and decentralized applications \(DApps\). This is especially useful to enforce business logic in a trusted way, extending verifiability from data to code.
