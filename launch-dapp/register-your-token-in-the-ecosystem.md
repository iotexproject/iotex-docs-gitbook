# Register your Token

If you already [deployed a token on the IoTeX blockchain](broken-reference), and you want it to show up into IoTeX ecosystem tools such as the [block explorer](https://iotexscan.io) and the official [ioPay wallets](https://iotex.io/iopay), then you can **register your token metadata** into the ecosystem using the link below:

After your submission is accepted, your token metadata will show up in the IoTeX explorer at [https://iotexscan.io/tokens](https://iotexscan.io/tokens):

and in the official [ioPay wallet apps](https://iotex.io/iopay):

Your Dapp, as well as any other ecosystem tool like [iotube](https://iotube.org) bridge or [mimo](https://mimo.finance) DEX, can also [fetch the metadata](https://github.com/iotexproject/iotex-token-metadata#usage) and use it in their frontends.
