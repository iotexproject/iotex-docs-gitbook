The growth and success of a blockchain ecosystem greatly depend on the quality and accessibility of its infrastructure and development tools. The IoTeX Halo Grants Program encourages developers to build innovative and user-friendly infrastructures and dev tooling that make it easier for other developers to create, test, and deploy their projects on the IoTeX platform. By leveraging IoTeX’s advanced technology and W3bstream infrastructure, our grant recipients can create powerful solutions that help streamline and enhance the development process for the entire IoTeX ecosystem.
