# DePIN

Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN) are transforming the way we interact with and manage physical systems by securely connecting IoT devices and infrastructure with blockchain technology. At IoTeX, we understand the tremendous potential of DePIN projects and encourage developers of all skill levels to join our grant program to create groundbreaking DePIN applications. We’re excited to support your journey in harnessing IoTeX and our layer-2 infrastructure, W3bstream, to shape the future of decentralized physical infrastructure. W3bstream plays a critical role in DePIN projects, providing the foundation for secure and efficient communication between smart devices and smart contracts.
