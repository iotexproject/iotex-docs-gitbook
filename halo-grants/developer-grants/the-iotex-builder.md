# The IoTeX Builder

This grant is intended for developers who want to focus on building a simple **DePIN** proof of concept, and offers up to **2000 USDT** (in hardware and funds) depending on your existing user base and your skills level, as well as the **quality of your content**.

As an IoTeX Builder, you'll have the opportunity to dive deeper into the IoTeX ecosystem, exploring the full potential of decentralized applications (dApps) using IoTeX and W3bstream. You'll work on more complex projects, such as developing DePIN solutions, or creating W3bstream-compatible smart devices, all while deploying your projects on the IoTeX Testnet and possibly even the Mainnet, depending on your application.

Join the ranks of the most skilled and ambitious developers in the IoTeX community as you take on the challenge of the IoTeX Builder Grant and make a lasting impact on the future of the connected world.
