# The IoTeX Explorer

This grant is intended for developers who want to focus on a particular component of our framework, such as creating a device prototype ([**RPi, Arduino, ESP32**](https://docs.w3bstream.com/client-device-sdks/introduction)), a [**W3bstream applet**](https://docs.w3bstream.com/applets-development/w3bstream-applet-kits), or a project configuration with a specific purpose (e.g. an applet, an indexer and an event routing strategy that are designed for a **DePIN** use case of your choice).

This grant offers up to **500 USDT** (in hardware and funds) depending on your existing user base and your skills level. If you don't have much of a user base, or you're just starting out, don't fret, we would still help you with your hardware, and we'll give you some community shoutouts.
