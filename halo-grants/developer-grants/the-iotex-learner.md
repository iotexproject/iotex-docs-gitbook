# The IoTeX Learner

The IoTeX Learner Grant is the first tier of our Developer Grants, specifically designed for those who are new to the IoTeX ecosystem and eager to learn. This tier offers a supportive environment for developers to familiarize themselves with the IoTeX platform, expand their knowledge, and gain hands-on experience.

The IoTeX Learner Grant focuses on providing resources such as test tokens, learning content, and access to our community of experienced developers. To complete this grant and get their SBT token, devs will have to pass a short live test with one of our team members.&#x20;
