Introducing the new **IoTeX Halo Grants Program**, managed by the [**IoTeX**](https://iotex.io/) Foundation, dedicated to fostering the growth and development of the IoTeX ecosystem. The Halo Grants Program empowers developers to create innovative Dapps in the fields of **DeFi**, **NFT**, **Gaming**, **Infrastructure/Developer Tooling**, and most importantly, **DePIN** (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks).

The revamped Halo Grants Program now features two main programs: **The Developer Grants** and **The Project Grants**. The Developer Grants, tailored for individual developers on a learning path, is divided into three tiers: **Learner**, **Explorer**, and **Builder**. Each tier caters to different developer backgrounds and experiences, ensuring that everyone can contribute to the growth and adoption of the IoTeX technology, ecosystem, and community.

The Project Grants, designed for professional developers and teams with proven experience, consists of two tiers: **The Integration Tier** and the **DePIN Incubator**. The Integration Tier focuses on projects porting Dapps or tools from other chains onto the IoTeX ecosystem, while the DePIN Incubator supports projects that either already have an existing product or possess expertise in their field, aiming to develop DePIN projects from scratch or add DePIN elements to their existing products.
