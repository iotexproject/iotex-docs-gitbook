Establishing a clear set of rules for grant proposal submissions is essential to ensure a fair, transparent, and efficient process for all participants. Adherence to these guidelines will enable the IoTeX Foundation to effectively evaluate, support, and fund projects that contribute to the growth and success of the IoTeX ecosystem.

1. Grant payments will be exclusively made in USDT tokens on the IoTeX Blockchain from the IoTeX Safe, ensuring a seamless and transparent funding process for all approved projects.
2. The IoTeX Foundation reserves the right to approve or decline a grant proposal at its sole discretion, regardless of whether a project meets the minimum requirements. This decision-making process ensures that only the most promising and impactful projects receive funding.
3. Only developers who are members of the IoTeX Developer Program are eligible to apply for a grant. Joining the IoTeX Developer Program is a simple process that offers numerous benefits. Visit the [Developer Portal](https://developers.iotex.io/), sign up using your GitHub account, and start enjoying the advantages of being part of the IoTeX Developer Program.
4. All grant proposals must align with the objectives and values of the IoTeX ecosystem and contribute to its growth, adoption, and community engagement.
5. Grant recipients are expected to adhere to the project milestones and timelines outlined in their approved proposal. Failure to meet these expectations may result in the termination of grant funding or other penalties.
6. Recipients must provide regular progress updates and maintain open communication with the IoTeX Foundation throughout the project’s development. This ensures ongoing support and guidance from the foundation and fosters a collaborative relationship between both parties.
7. Any changes to the project scope, timeline, or budget must be promptly communicated to and approved by the IoTeX Foundation. This allows for effective monitoring of project progress and ensures that the foundation’s resources are allocated efficiently.

By following these general rules, developers can help create a transparent, fair, and efficient grant proposal process that fosters innovation and growth within the IoTeX ecosystem.
