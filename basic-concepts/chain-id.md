# Chain ID

A **Chain ID** is a unique number assigned to different, independent IoTeX Blockchains. For example, IoTeX Mainnet chain has `Chain ID = 1`, while IoTeX Testnet has `Chain ID = 2`. Chain IDs in IoTeX are used for security reasons, by including it into transaction signature to prevent _transaction replay_ attacks on different networks.

## List of IoTeX Chain ID's

All IoTeX-based blockchains should adopt this _Chain ID Mechanism_, but replacing `CHAIN ID` with a different and **unique** value. All testnet, consortium and IoTeX-cloned chains are encouraged to do the same:

| `CHAIN ID` | Chain |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | IoTeX Mainnet |
| 2 | IoTeX Testnet |
