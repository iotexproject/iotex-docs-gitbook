# Introduction

IoTeX Blockchain integrates the Ethereum Virtual Machine \(EVM\), which is widely used by blockchain developers. Existing EVM-based dApps can be already ported over to the IoTeX Network **with no changes**!

### Solidity Programming Language <a id="solidity-programming-language"></a>

You can use **Solidity** as a programming language for IoTeX smart contracts: the blockchain is 100% compliant with Solidity syntax, up to its latest release.

You can find many resources about smart contract programming with Solidity on the Internet: starting from the [official docs ](http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/#the-solidity-contract-oriented-programming-language), to this [best practice handbook ](https://yos.io/2019/11/10/smart-contract-development-best-practices/)and the popular [CryptoZombies ](https://cryptozombies.io/)interactive course, plenty of choices are available!

Another great source to start with is this book from 'O Really: [Mastering Ethereum: Building Smart Contracts and DApps - 1st Edition \(opens new window\)](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook#mastering-ethereum)that is freely readable on GitHub.

### Advantages of IoTeX Smart Contracts <a id="smart-contracts-iotex-vs-ethereum"></a>

Besides IoTeX smart contracts being fully compatible with Ethereum ones, developing your contracts on the IoTeX blockchain brings some additional benefits: IoTeX is designed to be an IoT-Friendly platform, where the blockchain is the orchestrating layer for devices coordination and end-to-end trusted data transfers.

For this reason, the IoTeX design provides a fast and scalable blockchain: that means **your smart contracts on IoTeX will run with a 5-second confirmation time**, **instant finality of transactions**, and negligible transaction fees! Additionally, with the unique-of-his-kind [IoTeX Tokenomics ](https://medium.com/@iotex/iotex-tokenomics-part-1-utility-of-the-iotx-token-781ff9c866e3)in place, millions of _"Powered by IoTeX"_ [IoT devices ](https://www.nordicsemi.com/News/2020/02/IoTeXs-Cellular-IoT-based-tracker-delivers-environmental-and-condition-data-for-assets-in-transit)getting registered on the blockchain, more and more [services providers ](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/case-study-iotex/)joining the ecosystem, the IoTeX blockchain is the perfect environment for deploying smart contracts that will be used in real-world applications!
