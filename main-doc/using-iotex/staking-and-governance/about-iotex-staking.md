# About IoTeX Staking

## What is IoTeX Staking

A core part of decentralized governance in the IoTeX Network is staking, where token holders deposit ("_stake"_) `IOTX` in the IoTeX blockchain to facilitate network operations, consensus, and governance. By staking, token holders earn rewards, contributing to an attractive passive income stream. Additionally, staking strengthens the IoTeX network security and stability, as it supports the decentralization of block production.&#x20;

By participating in staking, you also gain a voice in IoTeX governance, allowing you to influence key decisions and the future direction of IoTeX. Overall, staking in IoTeX is not just a financial endeavor; it's an opportunity to be an integral part of a growing blockchain ecosystem.
