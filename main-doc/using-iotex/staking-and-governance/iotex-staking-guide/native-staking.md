# Native Staking

Native staking happens by interacting with a dedicated, protocol-level staking mechanism, which means it operates at the core layer of the blockchain without the need for additional smart contracts.

#### Why Choose Native Staking?

This option offers complete flexibility concerning the amount you choose to stake, the lock time, and the Stake-Lock options. Additionally, it allows you to increase the deposit of existing stakes at a later time, and it incurs a lower fee for any staking action
