# IoTeX Staking Guide

## **Choose a Wallet**

To begin staking IOTX, you will need a compatible wallet. Use ioPay if you prefer to manage your stakes on a mobile phone, or MetaMask for managing your stake from a desktop.

[Learn how to configure Metamask and ioPay Wallets ->](../../metamask/)

## **Acquire IOTX Tokens**

To start, purchase IOTX tokens from a cryptocurrency exchange. Then, transfer them to your chosen wallet. For detailed guidance on funding your wallet, follow this link:

[Learn how to fund your wallet ->](../../metamask/iotx-faucets/)

## **Access the IoTeX Staking Portal**

This can be done directly through the ioPay app's in-built browser or via a Metamask-enabled web browser. Once you reach the staking portal, you will be prompted to choose between two staking methods: 'Native Staking' or 'Stake as NFT'.

[Access the Staking Portal ->](https://stake.iotex.io/stake)

In the first screen of the Staking process, you can browse the list of IoTeX Validators and choose one to delegate your IOTX tokens to. At any time you will be able to redirect your votes to a different delegate without the need to unstake your IOTX.

[Go to the Native Staking Guide ->](../../../../backlog/iotex-staking/iotex-staking-guide/native-staking.md)

[Got to the Staking as NFT Guide ->](staking-as-nft.md)

## What Delegate should I choose?

Delegates all have unique reward plans to cover costs, donate to funds, and re-distribute rewards to their voters. Think of it as Delegates charging a service fee to stake your token.&#x20;

Create a diverse voting portfolio that is representative of your vision for the future of IoTeX.&#x20;

* **Community:** If you want IoTeX to prioritize community, vote for an IoTeX Ambassador!&#x20;
* **DApps:** If you want to prioritize dApp development, vote for a Dev Group!
* **Enterprise**: If you want enterprise to be a priority, vote for a delegate founded by an investor.

{% hint style="info" %}
The difference in rewards across Delegates is marginal (i.e., 80% vs. 85%), but the difference in potential impact can be large – **vote for multiple delegates, and** **vote for the benefit of IoTeX**!
{% endhint %}

<summary>About Staking as NFT</summary>

Staking as NFT introduces Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent your staking deposits. In this mechanism, when you stake your tokens, you receive an NFT that signifies ownership and details of the staked amount and lock options.

#### Why Choose Staking as NFT?

Staking as NFT enables participation in Liquid Staking or other DeFi applications and unlocks the potential to earn additional passive income. Furthermore, you have the option to liquidate your stake in an [NFT marketplace](https://nft.mimo.exchange/) if you prefer not to wait for the lock period to conclude.

Opt for this option when your staking deposit aligns with one of the fixed amounts of 10k, 100k, or 1M IOTX, and you are willing to lock your deposit for at least 91 days.

## **Decide the amount of IOTX**

{% hint style="info" %}
There is a minimum staking requirement of 100 IOTX.
{% endhint %}

In the next screen, you can select the Decide the amount of IOTX you want to stake.&#x20;

&#x20;Please make sure you do not select your entire balance: you should leave a fraction of IOTX (e.g. 0.1 IOTX) out to cover for staking transactions.

### How to select the right amount?

### **Understand Lock-up Period**

Be aware of any lock-up periods during which you cannot withdraw your staked tokens.

### **Earn Rewards**

Staking IOTX earns you rewards, usually distributed automatically to your wallet.

### **Participate in Governance**

As a staker, you may have the right to participate in IoTeX governance decisions, contributing to the future direction of the network.

### **Unstaking**

If you decide to unstake, follow the platform's process for withdrawing your tokens. Note there is a 3-days "_unbonding period_" before the tokens can be withdrawn. During this period the tokens will not generate rewards.

### **Stay Informed**

Keep up-to-date with IoTeX news and updates, as changes to the network or staking process can impact your participation.
