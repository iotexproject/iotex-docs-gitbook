# Manage ERC20 Tokens

In the world of blockchain and cryptocurrencies, keeping track of your digital assets is crucial. Wallets like Metamask and ioPay not only display your native token balance on the selected blockchain, but also enable you to monitor other assets, like "ERC20 tokens." or "NFT Tokens".

This guide will walk you through the process of adding ERC20 tokens to your wallet, ensuring that you have complete visibility over your digital portfolio.

## **Adding ERC20 Tokens to Metamask**

1. **Accessing the Token Section:**
   * Open Metamask and navigate to the "Tokens" tab.
   * At the bottom of this tab, you'll find the "`+ Import Token`" option. Click on it to proceed.
2. **Locating the Token Address:**
   * To add a specific token, such as `CIOTX`, first locate its contract address. A reliable way to do this is by using a blockchain explorer like etherscan.io.
   * Go to [etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io) and use the search bar to enter "`CIOTX`".
   * Select "_CIOTX (Crosschain IOTX)_" from the search results to view its dedicated page.
3. **Importing the Token:**
   * On the `CIOTX` token page in Etherscan, you have two options:
     * Manually copy the contract address and paste it into the Metamask token import field.
     * Use the "**More**" dropdown menu and select "_Add Token to Metamask_". This automates the process, adding that token to your Metamask token balances.

## **Adding ERC20 Tokens to ioPay**

1. **Selecting the Token:**
   * Open your ioPay wallet.
   * Look for the `(+)` button in the tokens panel below the native balance section.&#x20;
   * Tap the `(+)` button and select the tokens that you want to show in the list.
