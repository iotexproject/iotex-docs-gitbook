# Overview

Self-sovereign identity is user- and device-centric where an individual or organization or device is able to own its own identity attributes without relying on third-party service providers. Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of identifier for verifiable 'self-sovereign' digital identity for individuals, organizations and things. DIDs have the following important properties:

* **Decentralized**: DIDs are designed to function without a central registration authority. DIDs are registered in blockchain or other decentralized network.
* **Cryptographically Verifiable**: DIDs are designed to be associated with cryptographic keys and the entities controlling the DID can use those keys to prove ownership.
* **Non-Reassignable**: DIDs should be permanent, persistent, and non-reassignable.
* **Resolvable**: DIDs are made useful through resolution.

IoTeX DID has been integrated into [uniresolver.io](http://uniresolver.io), which is the industrial de-facto that resolves DIDs to the corresponding document

Next sections provide the specification of how DID works within the IoTeX Network.
